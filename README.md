# meshtastic-environment

Receives environment broadcasts in protobuf format, so they can be used in
Python.

Meshtastic's Python library has done most of the things. I'm just trying to
learn how to use them.

This repo has been tested with Meshtastic Python library 2.0.6, firmware 2.0.9
(customized and currently PR to upstream) with SHT31 temperature and humidity
sensors on three Lilygo TBeam 1.1.
